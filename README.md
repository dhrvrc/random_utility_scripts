# random_utility_scripts

A bunch of random shell scritps that you might never need.

Note that running some of them with ```shell source script.sh```  instead of the ```shell ./script.sh``` results in exiting (because of some ```shell exit``` commands)the current shell session and you might need to start a new shell tab/window to continue. Using the ```shell ./script.sh``` syntax give you the prompt back without needing a new tab/window.
