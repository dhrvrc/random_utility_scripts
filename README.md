# random_utility_scripts

A bunch of random shell scritps that you might never need.

First line of each script briefly descibes what its intended to do.

Feel free contribute? Fork -> Add Changes -> Commit -> Pull Request

## Note
Running some of the scripts with ```source script.sh``` results in exiting the current shell session. (because of how some shells handle ```exit``` commands). You might see something like the following output and the shell becomes uninteractive. 
```console
Saving session...
...copying shared history...
...saving history...truncating history files...
...completed.

[Process completed]
```
You'll need to start a new shell tab/window to continue.
 
Using the ```./script.sh``` syntax gives you the prompt back without needing a new tab/window.
